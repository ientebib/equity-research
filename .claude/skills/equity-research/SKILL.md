- Fundamental analysis and valuation
- Industry competitive dynamics
- Financial modeling
- Investment thesis construction

## Investment Analysis Frameworks

### Porter's Five Forces (Competitive Analysis)
When analyzing competitive positioning:
1. **Threat of New Entrants**: Capital requirements, switching costs, brand loyalty, regulatory barriers
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: Supplier concentration, importance of volume, differentiation
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: Buyer concentration, price sensitivity, switching costs
4. **Threat of Substitutes**: Relative price/performance, switching costs
5. **Competitive Rivalry**: Number of competitors, industry growth, fixed costs, exit barriers

### Moat Analysis
Identify sustainable competitive advantages:
- **Network Effects**: Value increases with users (platforms, marketplaces)
- **Switching Costs**: Cost of changing to competitor (enterprise software)
- **Intangible Assets**: Brands, patents, regulatory licenses
- **Cost Advantages**: Scale economies, process advantages, resource access
- **Efficient Scale**: Market only supports limited competition

### Quality Assessment
Rate management and business quality:
- **Capital Allocation**: Track record of M&A, buybacks, dividends
- **Insider Ownership**: Alignment with shareholders
- **Corporate Governance**: Board independence, compensation structure
- **ESG Factors**: Material sustainability issues

## Valuation Methodologies

### DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)
Core intrinsic value methodology:

```
Enterprise Value = Σ (FCF_t / (1 + WACC)^t) + Terminal Value / (1 + WACC)^n

Where:
- FCF = EBIT(1-T) + D&A - CapEx - ΔNWC
- WACC = E/V × Re + D/V × Rd × (1-T)
- Terminal Value = FCF_n+1 / (WACC - g)
```

**Key Assumptions to State:**
- Revenue growth rates (with justification)
- Operating margin trajectory
- Capital intensity (CapEx/Revenue)
- Working capital requirements
- WACC components (risk-free rate, beta, equity risk premium, cost of debt)
- Terminal growth rate (typically 2-3% for mature companies)

### Trading Comparables
Relative valuation approach:
- **EV/Revenue**: For growth companies, pre-profit
- **EV/EBITDA**: Standard for profitable companies
- **P/E**: Traditional earnings-based
- **PEG**: P/E adjusted for growth
- **EV/FCF**: Cash flow focused

Always state:
- Comparable set selection criteria
- Premium/discount justification
- Historical range context

### Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP)
For conglomerates or hidden value:
- Value each business segment separately
- Apply segment-appropriate multiples
- Add/subtract corporate costs, net debt
- Identify valuation gaps vs pure-plays

## Financial Metrics to Analyze

### Profitability
- **Gross Margin**: Pricing power, cost structure
- **Operating Margin**: Operational efficiency
- **EBITDA Margin**: Cash generation proxy
- **Net Margin**: Bottom-line profitability
- **ROIC**: Return on invested capital (vs WACC)
- **ROE**: Return on equity (DuPont decomposition)

### Growth
- **Revenue CAGR**: Top-line trajectory (3Y, 5Y)
- **EPS Growth**: Earnings trajectory
- **Organic vs Inorganic**: M&A impact
- **Same-store/Comparable**: Underlying growth

### Financial Health
- **Net Debt/EBITDA**: Leverage ratio
- **Interest Coverage**: EBIT/Interest
- **Current Ratio**: Liquidity
- **FCF Conversion**: FCF/Net Income
- **Days Sales Outstanding**: Working capital efficiency

## Research Report Structure

### Executive Summary (1 page)
1. Investment Rating: BUY/HOLD/SELL
2. Price Target: Current price → Target (+X% upside/downside)
3. Key Investment Points: 3 bullets
4. Key Risks: 2-3 bullets

### Investment Thesis (2-3 pages)
- Business description and model
- Competitive position and moats
- Growth drivers (quantified)
- Margin trajectory
- Management quality

### Bull Case / Bear Case (1 page each)
- Scenario assumptions
- Probability-weighted outcomes
- What would change the view

### Valuation (2-3 pages)
- Primary methodology with assumptions
- Sensitivity analysis
- Cross-check with alternatives
- Historical context

### Risks & Catalysts (1 page)
- Ranked by probability and impact
- Mitigating factors
- Timeline for catalysts

## Best Practices

### Evidence Standards
- Every claim must have a source
- Prefer primary sources (filings, transcripts, press releases)
- Note date of information
- Distinguish facts from opinions

### Quantification
- Always include specific numbers
- Use ranges for uncertainty
- State time periods clearly
- Normalize for one-time items

### Balance
- Present both bull and bear cases
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Avoid confirmation bias
- Update views with new information

### Citations
Format all sources as:
- [Company Name] [Document Type] [Date]
- Example: [GOOGL 10-K FY2025], [AAPL Q3'25 Earnings Call]
